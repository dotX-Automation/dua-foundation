# Scientific and AI libraries not included here are supposed to be
# included in the base l4t-ml image.

# Python basic tools and dependencies:
# - Testers
# - YAML, TOML parsers
# - Package managers
# - Code formatters
# - Code coverage testers
# - Code linters
# - Template engines
# - transitions library for FSM software
# - ROS 2 source build dependencies
# NOTES
# - empy==3.3.4 is required since colcon is not compatible with newer versions.
# - matplotlib and NumPy versions, as well as many other packages, are required
#   for various compatibility issues.
# - setuptools version is chosen to avoid issues with colcon.
